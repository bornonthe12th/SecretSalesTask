Secretsales.com Developer Task
￼Please follow the instructions below and send us your code once you’ve finished.
We want to see how you structure the code in files, classes and methods; how you solve the problem and how you present the code to us and the user within a browser or on the command line.
Write a PHP program that generates an XML file containing every 30th of June since the Unix Epoch, at 1pm GMT, similar to the one attached.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<timestamps>
<timestamp time="1246406400" text="2009-06-30 13:00:00" /> </timestamps>
The program must also be able to parse XML in that format and generate a second XML file sorted by timestamp in descending order, excluding years that are prime numbers. The timestamps generated should be at 1pm PST.
We must be able to run these steps separately.
Remember, you need to solve the problem but also show us your knowledge of professional PHP coding and OOP. The code must be written to production standard – the kind of thing you’d expect from anyone you work with. And it has to run first time.

To generate GMT XML timestamps navigate to SecretSalesTask directory and run php index.php
To parse an xml file run php index.php -p /path/to/file.xml
Generated XML files are stored in the data directory depending on which service you request it will either be stored in GMT/PST folder


Always remember to clear the cache at cache/classpaths.cache if you move the folder of the application to another location
